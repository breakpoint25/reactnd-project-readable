# Readable
This is the final assessment project for Udacity's Nanodegree React & Redux course.

A back-end api called 'server' was provided by Udacity for short term storage of Post and Comment data.

A front-end application called 'readable' was created from scratch to provide a Reddit-like application where users can create Posts, Comments, and Voting.

The application was built primarly using React, Redux, and React-Router.

## Installation

You must install and start the servers from both the 'readable' and 'server' directories.

* Install and start the Readable front-end application
    - `cd readable`
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`

* Install and start the Readable back-end API server
    - `cd server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`

Both servers must run concurrently for the application to operate properly.
